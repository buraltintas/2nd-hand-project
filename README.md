# 2nd Hand Project

This project is built with React.js for graduation of Protein React Bootcamp. You can check out other bootcamps on [Patika.dev](https://www.patika.dev/tr/bootcamp).

# Who is this app for?

In this application users can sell their used products or they can buy others products that are on sale. Instead of the current price, users can also make offers for the products.

# How to use?

- When you open the main page, you can see all the products and sort the products by category.
- You can become a member with the button on the header or log in if you are already a member.
- After logging in, you can purchase existing products or make an offer for products that owners want to receive offers.
- If there is a product you want to sell, you can create a new advert. When creating an advert, you can upload the product's information and a photo.
- If an item has already been sold, the warning 'This Item Is Not For Sale' is displayed.
- If you make an offer for a product, you must wait for the owner to accept or reject it.
- You can view the offers you have given and received on the 'My Account' page. You can evaluate the offers you receive. If your offers are accepted, you can complete the purchase.
- You can go to product page with clicking on product name or product image at 'My Account' page.
- You can share the link of products with your friends so they can buy or sell their used products. You can also share links with sorted products by categories.
- Enjoy!
